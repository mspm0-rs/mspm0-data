If CRCOUT is accessed as a half-word, and the OUTPUT_BYTESWAP is set to to 1, then the two bytes in the 16-bit access are swapped and returned. B1 is returned as B0 B0 is returned as B1 If CRCOUT is accessed as a word, and the OUTPUT_BYTESWAP is set to 1, then the four bytes in the 32-bit read are swapped. B3 is returned as B0 B2 is returned as B1 B1 is returned as B2 B0 is returned as B3 Note that if the CRC POLYSIZE is 16-bit and a 32-bit read of CRCOUT is performed with OUTPUT_BYTESWAP enabled, then the output is: MSB LSB 0x0 0x0 B0 B1 If the CRC POLYSIZE is 16-bit and a 32-bit read of CRCOUT is performed with OUTPUT_BYTESWAP disabled, then the output is: MSB LSB 0x0 0x0 B1 B0.'
