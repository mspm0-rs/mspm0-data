This initiates the serial read which consummates by setting the RD_SVBUS_DONE bit. At this point the addressed register may be read by a normal CPU read of the appropriate offset address. 0x000 Message RAM ECC controller is selected Others Reserved (do not use) Subsequent writes through the SVBUS (offsets 0x10 - 0x3B) have a delayed completion.

    description: 'Last Error Code. The LEC indicates the type of the last error to occur on the CAN bus. This field will be cleared to ''0'' when a message has been transferred (reception or transmission) without error. 0 No Error: No error occurred since LEC has been reset by successful reception or transmission. 1 Stuff Error: More than 5 equal bits in a sequence have occurred in a part of a received message where this is not allowed. 2 Form Error: A fixed format part of a received frame has the wrong format. 3 AckError: The message transmitted by the MCAN was not acknowledged by another node. 4 Bit1Error: During the transmission of a message (with the exception of the arbitration field), the device wanted to send a recessive level (bit of logical value ''1''), but the monitored bus value was dominant. 5 Bit0Error: During the transmission of a message (or acknowledge bit, or active error flag, or overload flag), the device wanted to send a dominant level (data or identifier bit logical value ''0''), but the monitored bus value was recessive. During Bus_Off recovery this status is set each time a sequence of 11 recessive bits has been monitored. This enables the CPU to monitor the proceeding of the Bus_Off recovery sequence (indicating the bus is not stuck at dominant or continuously disturbed). 6 CRCError: The CRC check sum of a received message was incorrect. The CRC of an incoming message does not match with the CRC calculated from the received data. 7 NoChange: Any read access to the Protocol Status Register re-initializes the LEC to ''7''. When the LEC shows the value ''7'', no CAN bus event was detected since the last CPU read access to the Protocol Status Register. Note: When a frame in CAN FD format has reached the data phase with BRS flag set, the next CAN event (error or valid frame) will be shown in DLEC instead of LEC. An error in a fixed stuff bit of a CAN FD CRC sequence will be shown as a Form Error, not Stuff Error. Note: The Bus_Off recovery sequence (see ISO 11898-1:2015) cannot be shortened by setting or resetting CCCR.INIT. If the device goes Bus_Off, it will set CCCR.INIT of its own accord, stopping all bus activities. Once CCCR.INIT has been cleared by the CPU, the device will then wait for 129 occurrences of Bus Idle (129 * 11 consecutive recessive bits) before resuming normal operation. At the end of the Bus_Off recovery sequence, the Error Management Counters will be reset. During the waiting time after the resetting of CCCR.INIT, each time a sequence of 11 recessive bits has been monitored, a Bit0Error code is written to PSR.LEC, enabling the CPU to readily check up whether the CAN bus is stuck at dominant or continuously disturbed and to monitor the Bus_Off recovery sequence. ECR.REC is used to count these sequences.'

    description: Cancellation Request 0. Each Tx Buffer has its own Cancellation Request bit. Writing a '1' will set the corresponding Cancellation Request bit; writing a '0' has no impact. This enables the Host to set cancellation requests for multiple Tx Buffers with one write to TXBCR. TXBCR bits are set only for those Tx Buffers configured via TXBC. The bits remain set until the corresponding bit of TXBRP is reset. 0 No cancellation pending 1 Cancellation pending Qualified Write is possible only with CCCR.CCE='0'.

  fields:

    description: 'Transmission Request Pending 0. Each Tx Buffer has its own Transmission Request Pending bit. The bits are set via register TXBAR. The bits are reset after a requested transmission has completed or has been cancelled via register TXBCR. TXBRP bits are set only for those Tx Buffers configured via TXBC. After a TXBRP bit has been set, a Tx scan is started to check for the pending Tx request with the highest priority (Tx Buffer with lowest Message ID). A cancellation request resets the corresponding transmission request pending bit of register TXBRP. In case a transmission has already been started when a cancellation is requested, this is done at the end of the transmission, regardless whether the transmission was successful or not. The cancellation request bits are reset directly after the corresponding TXBRP bit has been reset. After a cancellation has been requested, a finished cancellation is signalled via TXBCF - after successful transmission together with the corresponding TXBTO bit - when the transmission has not yet been started at the point of cancellation - when the transmission has been aborted due to lost arbitration - when an error occurred during frame transmission In DAR mode all transmissions are automatically cancelled if they are not successful. The corresponding TXBCF bit is set for all unsuccessful transmissions. 0 No transmission request pending 1 Transmission request pending Note: TXBRP bits which are set while a Tx scan is in progress are not considered during this particular Tx scan. In case a cancellation is requested for such a Tx Buffer, this Add Request is cancelled immediately, the corresponding TXBRP bit is reset.'
