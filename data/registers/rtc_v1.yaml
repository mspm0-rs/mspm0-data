fieldset/TCMP:
  description: RTC Temperature Compensation Register.
  fields:
  - name: RTCTCMPX
    description: Real-time clock temperature compensation. Value written into this register is used for temperature compensation of RTC. Each LSB represents approximately +1ppm (RTCTCMPS = 1) or -1ppm (RTCTCMPS = 0) adjustment in frequency. Maximum effective calibration value is +/-240ppm. Excess values written above +/-240ppm are ignored by hardware. Reading from RTCTCMP register at any time returns the cumulative value which is the signed addition of RTCOCALx and RTCTCMPX values, and the updated sign bit (RTCTCMPS) of the addition result.
