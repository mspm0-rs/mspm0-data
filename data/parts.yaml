# Data relating to part numbers.
#
# The metadata for code generation is based off of general families of chips. However the SysConfig metadata
# deals very little with specific part numbers. This data fills in the gaps.
#
# In particular this file describes the following:
# - Part numbers within each "family" according to SysConfig/SDK metadata
# - Datasheet, reference manual and errata URLs
# - Flash and RAM amounts (SysConfig does not describe this per part number)
# - The packages available for each part number.
